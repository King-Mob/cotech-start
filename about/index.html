<h1>Dr. Doug Belshaw</h1>
<h2><b>Open Strategist</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm a strategist advocating for greater openness and transparency in the world. I now work primarily through <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> but also via <a href="https://dynamicskillset.com">Dynamic Skillset</a> the consultancy business I own with my wife <a href="https://hannahbelshaw.com">Hannah Belshaw</a> a UX designer.</p>
  <p>I work from home in Northumberland, the English county of castles and coastlines, with my wife and two children. My career has taken me from History teacher through to co-op founder, through a variety of interesting roles along the way with organisations large and small.</p>
  <p>I'm perhaps best known for my work on digital literacies, having successfully defended my <a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/thesis.html">doctoral thesis</a> on the topic and then subsequently wrote a book entitled <em>The Essential Elements of Digital Literacies</em>. I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8yQPoTcZ78">TEDx talk</a> which has over 125,000 views, and my thesis has been accessed almost a million times. My ebook is on the reading list of Masters-level university courses around the world, and I spent a few years as Mozilla's Web Literacy lead.</p>
  <p>As a believer in re-decentralising the web, it was my privilege to build a team to deliver the world's first federated, resource-centric, social network for educators. I took the <a href="https://moodle.com/moodlenet">MoodleNet</a> project from zero to one after building a talented and diverse team.</p>     
  <p>I'm an evangelist for <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> which is a form of digital credentialing. I've spoken about this and many other topics at hundreds of events. It was the reason I joined the <a href="https://mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> in 2012 as, despite my formal qualifications, I believe peer-to-peer credentialing to be much more powerful.</p>
