<h1>Dr. Doug Belshaw</h1>
<h2><b>Open Strategist</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm an technologist, leader, and educator advocating for greater openness and transparency in the world. I now work primarily through <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> and occasionally through <a href="https://dynamicskillset.com">Dynamic Skillset</a> the consultancy business I own with my wife.</p>
  <p>I work from home in Northumberland, the English county of castles and coastlines I've had a varied career, following my interests and values.</p>
  <p>I'm perhaps best known for my work on digital literacies. I successfully defended my <a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/thesis.html">doctoral thesis</a> on the topic and then wrote a book entitled <em>The Essential Elements of Digital Literacies</em> during the time I was Mozilla's Web Literacy lead.</p>
  <p>In addition, I'm known for my evangelism of <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> which is a form of web-native digtital credentialing. I've spoken about this and many other topics at hundreds of events. It was the original reason I joined Mozilla.</p>
  <p>I'm trying to make the world a better place than I found it. If you're doing something similar, let's talk!</p>
